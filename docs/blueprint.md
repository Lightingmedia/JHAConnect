## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant peach (#FFA07A), reminiscent of community warmth and connection.
- Background color: Very light peach (#FAF0E6), providing a soft, translucent base.
- Accent color: Soft coral (#F08080) to highlight key interactions.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines, 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text. This provides a modern but accessible look.
- Use modern, minimalist icons that align with the translucent design theme. All icons should be simple and use the accent color.
- Maintain a clean, mobile-first layout with generous spacing. Use translucent panels and modals to give a layered feel.
- Employ subtle, smooth transitions for UI elements, particularly modals and notifications. Animations should enhance, not distract.
